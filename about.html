        <p>My name is Marlange I'm 17 years old and i'm a fashion freak. By the time I was 9 I wanted to be a fashion designer. I started drawing sketches 
        and they were pretty good so I kept it going. When I was 11 I wanted to be a model so I started looking up different agencies. 
        Then again when I was 12 I wanted to be  a stylist I did different outfit combinations helped others with their outfits and more.
        Another twist when I was 13 I wanted to be a journalist I loved witting and most of all I love writing about clothes. So now that 
        I'm 14 I realized that I loved doing all of those things so why not combine them that's when i created website called "STYLE ATTAQUE". 
        I wanted to created this awesome WEBAZINE/BLOG that girls all over would enjoy. Even though after highschool i plan on studying fashion journalism 
        i've also decided to take in interest in coding "I'm a dreamer.</p>
